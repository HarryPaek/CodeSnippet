I will be out of the office on personal leave until July 15th, during which I most certainly watch the movie adaptation of Jeff Benedict's "Poisoned" on Netflix. This story fundamentally changed our approach to food safety in America like no other.

Right after my return, I will attend IFT First in Chicago July 16th - 19th and would love to discuss with you in booth #S1368 how Centric 8 helps your company to improve Food Safety and address some of the challenges immortalized in the book and movie.

Your email is going to be answered after my return July 21st, as I will check my email infrequently and rarely during that time.
